# Text Generation with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) using Keras

Last Page Update: **25/05/2020**


 This project allows you to train a simple Long Short-Term Memory to learn sequences of characters from ['The Alchemist' book -  (Part One, Part Two and Epilogue)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Alchemist_(novel)). It's a novel by Brazilian author [Paulo Coelho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulo_Coelho) that was first published in 1988.
